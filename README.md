## <strong>Description</strong>

This is a simple tech blog that developers can use to share technology/programming news and can comment on other user's posts. It is built using the Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the object relation manager, and express-session to authenticate users.
